## The Mission as a UX Designer

<strong>Accessability</strong> - useable by all kinds of people. Is ADA Compliant.

<strong>Usability</strong> - Design is made to be in intuitive experience. Using best practices that capture the product and all its intentions.

<strong>Simplicity</strong> - Always striving for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) while keeping up with the unique abilities of the product.

<strong>Elegance</strong> - Tasteful aesthetics to highlight the product by using Webstandard fonts, curves, and more.

<strong>Growth</strong> - Lifelong learning is an important part of continuing to be a good User Experience Designer.

These are the standards I use as a User Experience Designer. Everyone in the tech world says they want to make the world a better place, well I mean to try one product at a time. By using these common standards along with best practices, a product can be at its best, shine, and reach the people who need it the most. 

Working with development, marketing, and design teams, cooperating with user data and research, as well as continuing to grow with the product and the need of the users is key to finding yourself with an ongoing successful product.
