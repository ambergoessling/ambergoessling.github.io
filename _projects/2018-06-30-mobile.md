## Mobile App Examples and Workflows

## Overview

This was idea that came to me while trying to use 3 different apps to try to order food online during the pandemic. There were also restuarants that didn't even advertise on these, but had a totally seperate payment app. You'll see how I try to have both ideas combined into a full product that both customers and restuarant owners could use easily. Research was used by collecting data on the three biggest delivery apps: Grubhub, Door Dash, and Eat Street.

## Workflows
These are the three main user workflows I wanted to work with and the three most important to the app.

## Ideas, Wireframes, Mockups

I thought of several ways of trying show how I wanted the app screens to interact with customer and restaurant owner. Missing is the user picking out food and adding it to the cart. This is because I am currently doing more research into it and wanted to be able to see more data before I made wireframes.
