## Overview

This project was born out of a love for skateboard deck collecting, and trying to keep track of when decks would go on sale through multiple sites. When creating this website, I did research on other skateboarding websites like, Sector 9, Vans, Primitive, and many more.

## Personas

## Sketch Wireframe Examples

Here are examples of the first few pages of the design process of brainstorming. Designing what pages would look like for the layout, and describing light functionality.

## Sitemap

Every website needs a basic sitemap (at least behind the scenes). Honestly, I used this to help organize my thoughts for the workflows and make sure I had all the pages accounted for.

## Workflows

Users can have multiple workflows on this site. The diagram below highlights the "happy path" and intended workflows. When this product gets more testing in the prototyping phase, then we can see which workflows feel most intuitive for users.

## Prototype

Prototype includes interactive pages and sections. Here is the <a href="https://y9cg5q.axshare.com"> Axure Link </a>

## Testing

This is a very new project I wanted to present, and it unfortunately does not have any testing right now. However, I plan to use data from surveys and AB testing to flesh out the design further.
