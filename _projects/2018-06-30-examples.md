## Welcome to the additional projects section

In this section I will be highlighting some home pages, and other projects started that didn't quite take off. Some of the projects include major design changes from the initial mockups based on feedback, and some are just ideas I had and would like to continue at a future date. 

## Projects for Developers

I collaborated with a friend to come up with a solution for developer interviews at tech companies by providing projects that can meet certain criteria for profeciency. The homepage features projects from the top contributers, and is a mostly anonymous site, unless you want to contact the contributer directly to inquire about their skills. This is still an ongoing project. 

This is still in the discovery stage.

## Corgi Clothing

Welcome to the high fashion corgi clothing site on the internet: Corgi Clothing! People love their dogs, and this was inspiried by my little dog, Lucy the corgi. While she doesn't like to dress up, some corgis do. Where do you find clothes just for a corgi? Here of course! 

Between the Wireframe and the Mockup some elements changed, like for example a hero image was added. This was to grab the users attention to a new piece of clothing or item we wanted to promote. The Mockup is also longer, this is to hold additional image layouts and spacing for the site.

Not much more was done for this project. It is in a backlog of fun projects that will be picked up in the future.
